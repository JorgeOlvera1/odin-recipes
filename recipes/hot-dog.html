    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For a classic outdoor snack with a handheld twist, these hot dogs will make any camper happy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 hot dogs</li>
        <li>3 sticks string cheese, cut or peeled into thin strips</li>
        <li>1 can pizza dough, cut length wise into 6 1 in (2 1/2 cm) wide strips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Insert a skewer into a hot dog. Cut a spiral by holding your knife at a diagonal to the top of the hot dog
            and rolling it down along a cutting board until you reach the bottom.</li>
        <li>Wind a strip of cheese into the spiral groove on the hot dog. You may need 2 strips of cheese to fill the
            entire spiral.</li>
        <li>Lay a strip of pizza dough on a cutting board and place the end of the hot dog skewer on a diagonal. Gently
            roll the hot dog in the dough, ensuring that the dough overlaps so no cheese leaks through. Gently remove
            the skewer and loosely wrap the hot dog in a sheet of foil so the dough has room to expand as it cooks.
            Repeat with the remaining hot dogs and dough.</li>
        <li>Place the hot dogs over low heat on a campfire or grill. Let them cook for 10 minutes, check to see that the
            dough has puffed, then flip over to cook through, about 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Let the hot dogs cool for a few minutes before carefully unwrapping, then serve with ketchup, mustard,
            relish, and onion.</li>
    </ol>
